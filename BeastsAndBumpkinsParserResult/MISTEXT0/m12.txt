This mission takes place on the frontier between you and your enemy. In the upper right corner of the map, you have a vital observation post. Only a specially-trained enemy BomberMan can destroy this building. There is also a well-protected enemy observation post on the left of the map. This building is destructible only with the help of your BomberMan, who is being held captive on an island some distance away. Your objectives are threefold: to keep the enemy BomberMan away from your observation post, rescue your own BomberMan and destroy the enemy observation post.
