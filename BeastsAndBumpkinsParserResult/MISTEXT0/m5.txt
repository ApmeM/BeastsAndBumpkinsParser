Dreadful tidings, Lord Mildew. The death of King Roland has left a power vacuum in Lokyerdore which the forces of darkness have been happy to fill. Evidence of this is all around you. The Dark Lord who stalks the land has infested the town next to your own with zombies. Destroy this evil hole using every means at your disposal, before the zombies destroy you. This will require you to collect a legendary weapon. At the same time you need to increase the population of the village to 10 people; protect your womenfolk.
