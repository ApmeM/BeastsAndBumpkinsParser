A Good look around the land reveals some wandering cattle. To claim them for yourself, select a peasant and click on a cow; you can claim as many cows as you like. To de-select a cow, click on it again with the same peasant, a "moo" will confirm this. Your cows wear purple collars to make it obvious who owns them.
