Many years ago your great-grandfather signed a non-aggression treaty with the neighbouring Ringworm clan. While this didn't stop the present Lord Ringworm moving in on your lands during your exile, a treaty signed in blood is not to be broken lightly. Your objective here is to remove Ringworm and his scurvy peasants without actually going to war with him. There's only one way to achieve this - by infecting them with the plague. Your first task is to locate the Monastery where the Spell of Plague can be purchased, for a price.
