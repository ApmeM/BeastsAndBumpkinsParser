Greetings... I hear you are on a quest to rid this island of the evil giant Deavo. Rumours tell of an almost forgotten, but still fearsome warrior, Thrice Knightly, who is sure to be a match for the giant. Seek out the friendly Monk who will offer a way of releasing Thrice thereby helping you on your quest.
