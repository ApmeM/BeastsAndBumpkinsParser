Greetings Nobleman, I'm afraid that your village is in terrible danger. A curse has been cast on your village by the Dark Lord, alarmed by your continued expansion. Survive the onslaught of zombies and care for your sick until the curse has passed. If your population should drop below 3 villagers, or your church becomes home to the Dark Lord's evil minions, your cause will be lost. Fare thee well!
