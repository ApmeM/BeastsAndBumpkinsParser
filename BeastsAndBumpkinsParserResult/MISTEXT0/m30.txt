The Dark Lord has gathered his forces for the final attack. You know that your only hope is to summon demons from the netherworld whose hearts are as black as the Dark Lord himself to do battle on your behalf. Seek the ancient ruins and perform the spell to control the demons. Only then will you be able to aid your peasants in the battle that lies ahead. The town of Parpton also constitutes a threat - reduce it to a pile of rubble.
