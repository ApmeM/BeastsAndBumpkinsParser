Good morrow fair traveller. I see from your hefty sack that you have at least 20,000 gold pieces, which co-incidentally is just enough to purchase the Spell of Teleportation. The spell is only of use to the gifted, so why not lead your wizard Wilberforce to me and I'm sure we can come to some arrangement.
