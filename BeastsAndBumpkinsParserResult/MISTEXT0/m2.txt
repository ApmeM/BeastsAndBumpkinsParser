You've successfully landed back on the mainland, in a remote part of Lokyadore where there are no rival nobles to inform King Roland of your return.  If you're ever to reclaim your old lands you're going to need cash, so your goal here is to swell your coffers by 10,000 gold coins. Beware, as there are a lot of nasty creatures around. Also, some items can be destroyed by pressing Ctrl key and then selecting your target.
