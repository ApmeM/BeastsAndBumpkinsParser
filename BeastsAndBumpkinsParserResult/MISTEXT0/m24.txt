You've succeeded in reclaiming almost all of the land that was once yours. Marrying off your son Lurkio to the daughter of the largest land-owner in Lokyadore, Sir Tannly-Knot, will give you access to an area of countryside even greater than that which you possessed before. All that's left for you to do is escort the Prince and Princess to the holy church for the wedding of the year. It's a hazardous journey, so it may be a good idea to get the wizard Wilberforce to guide you. There's a rumour that he's living alone somewhere in the forest.
