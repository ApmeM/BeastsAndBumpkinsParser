The evil Lord Randybar has sold his soul to the Dark Lord and his village, Grymton, has since grown far too powerful and become a threat to your own settlements. Build up your forces and wipe him out for good. There is another town, Gruffton, where the inhabitants feel similarly threatened. Keep out of their way, and they may take the brunt of any attack made by Lord Randybar.
