Lord Mildew, you and the few peasants still at your command have been banished to the remote island of Aorta by senile old King Roland, as punishment for your refusal to flatter his immense ego. Your immediate objective is to increase your peasant population to 6 people and grow your herd to 4 cattle. Hint: Place a couple of chicken houses down as your people are starving. Also, note that the more houses you build, the more people will reproduce. Good luck my Lord!
